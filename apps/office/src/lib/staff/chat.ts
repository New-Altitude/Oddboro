 * wrote, like a new manager's hello. An `item` line
 * is something the staffer put on the owner's desk, shown where it landed. An
 * owner's line with `re` replied about one of those. A `handOff` line is work
 * the staffer handed a colleague, or a colleague handed it. A `thread` line is
 * a thread the staffer leads, holding each hand-off it gave on it. A `lesson`
 * line is one the staffer kept, where it kept it. A `failed` line is the error a
 * chat run ended with, saved in place of its reply: the staffer never said it.
 * `inSession` on it means the run's tool named a session before it failed, so
 * that session holds the owner's line before it.
