// How the owner installs the office's Grok, Codex and Gemini, signs each
// tool's accounts in (Claude Code's too), and gives Gemini its API key, from
// the office's page (routes/api/agents/[tool]), so no tool an Odd runs on
// needs Terminal. Each account is a folder of its own (accounts.ts), and a
// sign-in signs that one folder in. Claude Code's install is Setup's Claude
// card; its sign-in runs with the account's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so it never
// touches the owner's own login.
//
// Install runs the tool's own installer and sign-in its own sign-in command
// in the office's home for it, each streamed to the page through the runner
// Claude Code's uses (command-stream.ts), one at a time per tool. An install
// runs to its end, since one stopped halfway can leave the tool half
// installed or a shell's settings half written. Sign out removes that home's
// sign-in file and nothing else: it never runs a tool's own logout, since
// `GROK_HOME=<office> grok logout` removed the owner's own ~/.grok sign-in in
// the same second. The session at xAI or OpenAI lasts until it ends or the
// owner removes it in their account. Server only.
