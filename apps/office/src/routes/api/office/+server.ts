// Everything the page shows that can change: the staff with the guesses each
// has waiting, the owner's desk, who is
// working and on what, the follow-ups waiting to start, the names the owner gave the rooms, what the owner switched off,
// the pokes that landed and wait unread, the threads a colleague holds for its lead,
// and each service's name.
// The page fetches it once, then
// again on each change event.
