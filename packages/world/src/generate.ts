// Builds an office from a short spec: which rooms, how big, how many desks,
// the materials and the extras. Claude writes the spec from the owner's
// words, and this turns it into a floor plan and room templates, the same
// shapes the hand-built Main Street uses. The limits live here, in code, so no
// spec can make a floor that breaks the office: too many rooms or desks, a
// seat nobody can reach, a building wider than the screen.
//
// The layout is always the same shape, so it always works:
//
//   back row of rooms, doors down into the main hall
//   main hall
//   front row of rooms between two side halls, doors down into the front hall
//   front hall, with the front door under the lobby
//   the street, with the bus stop staff arrive and leave by
//
// Everything is seeded from the spec, so the preview and the office it
// becomes are the same, tile for tile.
