// Threads: one piece of work an Odd chains through colleagues. Its first
// hand_off opens one with that Odd as the hub, and so does work it starts on
// its own for a goal, or a plan it raises for one (`goalThread`). Only the hub's runs hand off
// again, so it stays hub and spoke and never nests. The hub picks how it moves
// on: a colleague finishing, a time it sets (the office clock wakes it), a task
// on the owner's desk it parks on (task-parking.ts), or the owner answering something raised on it, or telling a colleague in its chat
// something about the thread (`tellLead`). The server holds the limit. From a
// chat or a job, the hub may continue a thread it leads instead of opening
// one, even a finished one, which reopens for a new round of work. A round
// takes up to `HAND_OFF_LIMIT` hand-offs; past it the owner decides whether
// the work keeps going, and a yes starts the hand-off that waited. While the plan's usage window is nearly used up, new
// hand-offs to Odds on Claude Code wait for it (usage-window.ts).
