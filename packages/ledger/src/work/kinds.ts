 * Work a staffer owes after the owner answers it: carry out an approved ask, rework
 * one the owner sent back, take in the reason for a no, pick up the work
 * that waited on a task the staffer gave them, or plan a goal the owner set. A
 * new hire with a job gets started without being asked by its `first_day`. A `hand_off` is
 * work a colleague handed it, and `handed_back` brings the result home. A
 * `resume` picks a thread back up for its hub: at the time the hub set, or with
 * the owner's answer when no other run follows it. An `answered` run hears the
 * owner's answer to something the staffer raised on no thread and no hand-off,
 * when no other run carries it. An `edited` run reads the owner's edit to one
 * of the staffer's files, for a lesson.
